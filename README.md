Hi, I'm Daniel Ng, or @danielzkng here on GitHub! I'm currently a rising senior at Carnegie Mellon University majoring in Computer Science and pursuing a concentration in Principles of Programming Languages.

Some interesting classes I'll be taking this semester:

* 15-281: Artificial Intelligence: Representation and Problem-Solving
* 15-330: Introduction to Computer Security
* 07-599: SCS Senior Thesis

I am doing my senior thesis with Professor Frank Pfenning, investigating the semi-axiomatic sequent calculus and its applications to parallel process calculi with memory reuse.

Some interesting classes I've taken so far:

* 15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation
* 15-151: Mathematical Foundations for Computer Science
* 21-241: Matrices and Linear Transformations
* 15-150: Principles of Functional Programming
* 15-251: Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science
* 07-180: Concepts of Artificial Intelligence
* 15-213: Introduction to Computer Systems
* 15-210: Parallel and Sequential Algorithms and Data Structures
* 15-312: Foundations of Programming Languages
* 21-259: Calculus in Three Dimensions
* 15-317: Constructive Logic
* 15-259: Probability and Computing
* 02-261: Quantitative Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory
* 07-300: Research and Innovation in Computer Science
* 15-440: Distributed Systems
* 15-451: Algorithm Design and Analysis
* 07-400: Research Practicum in Computer Science
* 15-411: Compiler Design

I'm also a current teaching assistant for 15-210, and previously TAed for 15-122 for both the Summer and Fall 2021 semesters.
